==Can you beileve Rails apps used to be written like this?

This isn't meant as a code sample... it was written over seven years ago (Rails 2.3.2!!!)

It is meant to provide a bit of perspective on the evolution of Rails as a platform,
what things were like before the rise of the cloud and some really awesome gems, 
and how easy it once was to raise money (this was the MVP that spawned a million dollar seed
round and served as a production server for at least a year.)

Obviously, its hard to imagine something like this being used in production today
not just because of the outdated technology stack, but because of the quality of the code and the 
number of ad hoc solutions. It really is amazing to see how the ecosystem arounds rails and application
development in general has matured. 

Anyway, take a look and wonder.
