Hey <%= @user.login%>,<br/><br/>

Looks like the fashists think your look, so cleverly entitled, "<%= link_to(@look.title, :controller => 'look', :action => 'view', :id => @look.id, :only_path => false, :host => "www.fashism.com") %>" is a <%= percentage(look) %>.<br/><br/>

We hope you're thinking the same thing... else there could be trouble.<br/><br/> 



Cheers,
Fashism Staff.<br/><br/>
